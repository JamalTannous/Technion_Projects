Designing a game using DE10-Standard Development Kit (Intel System-on-Chip (SoC) FPGA).
The project had some constraints, mainly a compilation time that does not exceed 10 minutes.
In order to withstand those constraints and simultaneously provide a "cool looking" game with descent graphics we came up with creative programming ideas that 
reduced the compilation time without affecting the quality of the product.
Through the project we built and programmed hardware modules using System Verilog.
After designing the modules we connected all of them together to form the gameplay.
